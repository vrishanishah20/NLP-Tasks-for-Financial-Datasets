Hello Prof,
This is Vrishani, an MS in AI student, I have a background in ML and DS and a bachelors in CS, I am really interested in Fintech and Quant jobs for the future and having a strong grasp of probability and statistics has become increasingly important in applying ML in finance. 
Can you please give me some information on what topics you cover and how the course structure is? And if it will help me in building logic and reasoning?

Looking forward to your reply!
